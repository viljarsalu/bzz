      <p>Elisabetes 3 is a historic property located in the most prestigious district of Riga,
the capital city of Latvia. This district is characterized by highly regarded architecture,
low traffic density, and proximity to the historic center of Riga as well as
its parks.<br />
Originally built in 1899, Elisabetes 3 was designed by architect Karl Johann
Felsko and has a fa√ßade decorated by sculptor August Folz. Formerly used as a
hotel, the building has an excellent view over a park and the River Daugava. Bizzi
& Partners Development acquired the property in 2006 and completed its renovation
into Class A office space in 2010. Studio Dini, an architecture firm based in
Milan, Italy and STATS Projekts, a local Latvian firm, designed the renovation
plans. RE&RE, a construction company with the best knowledge of renovation
and historical projects in Latvia, managed the implementation of the plans.</p>
