      <p>Giuseppe Rossi is the Executive Vice President of Development & Strategic Marketing of Bizzi & Partners Development.</p>
      <p>Mr. Rossi set up and directed the New York development team from 2006 to 2012, which is responsible for the firm’s operations in the United States. In 2010, Bizzi & Partners successfully completed its first project in this region - 400 Fifth Avenue in New York City.</p>
      <p>400 Fifth Avenue is a new 60-story tower designed by Gwathmey Siegel & Associates Architects that seamlessly blends 175 contemporary condominiums with 214-rooms world-class hotel Langham Place, Fifth Avenue (formerly The Setai Fifth Avenue). The 570,000-square-foot building is located at Fifth Avenue and 36th Street in Midtown Manhattan, and is also home to Michelin-star restaurant Ai Fiori, Measure lounge, Langham Place Spa, Julian Farel Salon, a state-of-the-art gym and a host of other premier amenities.</p>
      <p>Mr. Rossi was a vital player in the conception, planning and development of 400 Fifth Avenue. Under Mr. Rossi’s guard, the project earned recognition for its architectural integrity and sensitivity to the surrounding neighborhood, receiving unanimous approval from New York’s Landmark Preservation Commission, Community Board and City Council, among other institutions.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Mr. Rossi was involved in bringing celebrated chef Michael White onsite with his new restaurant Ai Fiori and selecting the hotel’s brand and operator. In 2012 and 2013, U.S. News & World Report Travel named The Setai Fifth Avenue the number one hotel in New York City.</p>
      <p>At the helm of the building’s unique branding program, Mr. Rossi partnered with Douglas Elliman Development Marketing in 2011 to launch the condominium sales campaign: “The Private Residences at 400 Fifth Avenue – a Gwathmey-Siegel Masterpiece". The campaign generated over 200 million dollars in sales in approximately 18 months.</p>
      <p>Prior to joining Bizzi & Partners in 2006, Mr. Rossi spent three years as a Project Manager with Bi&Di Real Estate S.p.a., a worldwide real estate development and trading company co-founded by Davide Bizzi, that operated in Italy, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, Cuba, the Baltic Republics and Russia. In this capacity he managed 25 residential and commercial projects totaling more than 2 million square feet.</p>
      <p>Mr. Rossi earned a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering and, in 2003, a Master's degree cum laude in Real Estate Management from Politecnico Di Milano in Milan, Italy.</p>
